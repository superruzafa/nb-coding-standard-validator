Go to *Tools* > *Options*. Then click on *Miscellaneous* section.

In the *Coding Standard Validator* tab you need to set the path to the PHP Code Sniffer script. You can enter it manually or browse your filesystem clicking "Browse...".

Once you find it, you need to enter the coding standard you want validate against to. Also you can test either your script works properly by clicking "Autodetect installed..." that will query the PHP Code Sniffer script for the installed standards. If the Coding Standard list is populated you are done.

Finally you may want to tune the information reported by PHP Code Sniffer by setting the type of report. If you are not sure leave it as "Default".
